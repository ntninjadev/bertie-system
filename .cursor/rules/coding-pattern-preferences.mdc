# Coding Pattern Preferences

## Core Principles
- Always prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid code duplication by checking existing codebase for similar functionality
- Write environment-aware code (dev, test, prod)
- Make only requested or well-understood changes
- Keep the codebase clean and organized

## Code Organization
- Avoid files exceeding 200-300 lines of code (refactor when approaching this limit)
- Avoid writing scripts in files unless necessary
- Never mock data for dev or prod environments (mocking only for tests)
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns affecting dev/prod environments
- Never overwrite `.env` file without explicit confirmation

## Bug Fixing & Changes
- Exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new patterns/technologies
- Remove old implementations when introducing new patterns
- Focus on maintaining consistency with existing codebase
