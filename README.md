# Bertie: Multi-Tenant SaaS Knowledge Platform

## üìù Overview
Bertie is a multi-tenant SaaS platform designed to empower experts (tenants) to create branded AI-powered knowledge hubs. Each tenant can offer personalized coaching, guided tools, learning resources, and direct user interactions through a seamless user interface.

The platform consists of two core dashboards:
- **Developer Dashboard**: Allows administrators to manage tenants, branding customization, coaches/tools (services), resources, membership tiers, subscriptions, and analytics.
- **User Dashboard**: Provides end users with access to expert-created content, personalized tools, and learning resources based on their subscription tier.

## üéØ Key Business Goals
- Enable experts to quickly launch their branded AI knowledge platforms
- Provide flexible subscription tiers that gate access to premium content and tools
- Secure multi-tenant data isolation leveraging Supabase with PostgreSQL and RLS policies

## üõ†Ô∏è System Architecture & Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Bolt.new**: For rapid static UI prototyping (Component & Page design)
- **Cursor**: Integrating dynamic logic (API calls, authentication flows) into imported Bolt.new components
- **React**: Core frontend framework with React Context for state management
- **Netlify**: CI/CD pipeline for deployments (DEV/TEST/PROD environments)

### Backend
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-service platform providing:
  - PostgreSQL Database
  - Authentication (Supabase Auth)
  - Storage (for managing tenant-specific assets such as images/videos/docs)
  - Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies

### External Integrations
- **MindPal**: Embedded AI coaching and tools via iframe
- **Stripe**: Subscription management & payments

## üìö Database Schema Overview

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| roles | Defines global roles (developer, tenant admin, user) |
| user_roles | Maps users to global roles |
| tenants | Stores tenant branding settings and configurations |
| user_tenants | Associates users with specific tenants |
| categories | Groups tenant-specific services/resources logically |
| membership_tiers | Defines tenant-specific subscription tiers |
| services | Unified table for coaches/tools with subscription gating logic |
| resources | Content resources (PDFs/videos/courses) gated by membership tiers |
| resource_courses | Manages course modules within resources |
| threads | User-created repository items |
| thread_contents | Saved content linked to repository threads |
| favorites | User bookmarks for services/resources (tenant-scoped) |
| subscriptions | Tracks user subscriptions & Stripe integration details |

### Important DB Design Principles:
- **Tenant Isolation**: All tenant-specific data is scoped with a tenant_id field and secured by Supabase RLS policies
- **Unified Service Model**: Coaches & tools share a table with a service_type discriminator field
- **Membership Tiers**: Service/resource access gated by defined subscription tiers

## üöÄ Implementation Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Supabase Connectivity Verification
- Confirm frontend Supabase connectivity & RLS enforcement

### ‚úÖ Authentication Setup
- Integrate Supabase Auth into frontend
- Implement global role assignments

### ‚úÖ Developer Dashboard CRUD
- CRUD operations for tenants, branding settings, membership tiers, services, and resources

### ‚úÖ Bolt.new UI Integration
- Import static UI components from Bolt.new into Cursor
- Dynamically integrate API calls & React context

### ‚úÖ User Dashboard Development
- Build tier-based content filtering & MindPal iframe integration

### ‚úÖ Stripe Subscription Management
- Implement Stripe webhook handling & Supabase integration

### ‚úÖ End-to-End Testing
- Comprehensive manual testing followed by automated testing setup

## üíª Development Workflow with Bolt.new & Cursor

### Bolt.new ‚û°Ô∏è Cursor Workflow:
1. Design static UI components/pages in Bolt.new
2. Export and import them into Cursor
3. Attach dynamic frontend logic (API calls, auth flows) in Cursor

### Cursor Best Practices:
- Provide targeted prompts specifying exactly what files/functions to modify
- Commit frequently and review diffs carefully to avoid unintended changes from Cursor Composer

### Version Control:
- GitHub feature branches & pull requests for each incremental change or feature set
- Thorough code reviews to ensure security and maintainability

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Pitfalls & Mitigation Strategies

| Pitfall | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|-------------------|
| Cursor Composer Overreach | Targeted prompts, frequent reviews & incremental commits |
| Authentication Integration | Independent testing of auth flows & RLS policy validation |
| Schema Stability | Lock DB schema early; careful planned future enhancements |
| Frontend/Backend Sync Issues | Clear component boundaries, incremental testing |

## ‚úÖ Code Quality & Simplicity Guidelines
- Keep SQL queries lean with clear documentation of schema & RLS policies
- Avoid unnecessary complexity; prefer React Context initially before introducing Redux/Zustand only if required later
- Clearly document component hierarchy and backend schema early in the development lifecycle

## üìñ Documentation & Testing Approach
- Document schema diagrams, API endpoints, RLS policies, and frontend component structure as we build incrementally
- Prioritize manual verification after each integration step initially; automate testing in later phases once core functionality is stable

## üé® Coding Pattern Preferences

### Core Principles
- Always prefer simple solutions over complex ones
- Avoid code duplication by checking existing codebase for similar functionality
- Write environment-aware code (dev, test, prod)
- Make only requested or well-understood changes
- Keep the codebase clean and organized

### Code Organization
- Avoid files exceeding 200-300 lines of code (refactor when approaching this limit)
- Avoid writing scripts in files unless necessary
- Never mock data for dev or prod environments (mocking only for tests)
- Never add stubbing or fake data patterns affecting dev/prod environments
- Never overwrite `.env` file without explicit confirmation

### Bug Fixing & Changes
- Exhaust existing implementation options before introducing new patterns/technologies
- Remove old implementations when introducing new patterns
- Focus on maintaining consistency with existing codebase

## üîÑ Coding Workflow Preferences

### Development Focus
- Concentrate only on code relevant to the current task
- Avoid modifying unrelated code
- Write thorough tests for all major functionality
- Consider impact on other methods and areas when making changes

### Architecture & Patterns
- Avoid major changes to working feature patterns/architecture without explicit instruction
- Maintain consistency with established patterns
- Document significant architectural decisions

## üìå Next Steps
Immediate next step is integrating Supabase Authentication into your frontend using the Cursor prompt provided above.
